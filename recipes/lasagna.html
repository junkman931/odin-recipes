    <h2>A classic recipe for homemade Lasagne al Forno (Italian Beef Lasagna) </h2>
    <p>There's truly nothing more comforting than a hot bubbling baked lasagna made with homemade beef ragu, bechamel sauce, silky pasta and topped with melted mozzarella cheese! This traditional Italian recipe will be a comfort food favourite.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ragu or meat sauce</li>
        <li>Pasta</li>
        <li>Bechamel sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely chop the carrot, celery and onion and sweat slowly with a little olive oil in a large, deep skillet or pan</li>
        <li>Once you've sauteed the veggies, add the meat and brown whilst breaking it up with a wooden spoon</li>
        <li>Add the red wine and reduce by half. Once the wine has reduced, add the sieved tomatoes, tomato paste, bay leaf, 4 cups of the beef stock and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir everything together and leave to simmer on a low heat for 2.5-3 hours uncovered. Add the rest of the beef stock half way through </li>
        <li>Add the butter to a saucepan and cook until melted and bubbling</li>
        <li>Add the flour to the melted butter and stir to form a paste. Let the flour cook for 1 minute</li>
        <li>Slowly whisk half of the milk into the butter and flour constantly whisking to avoid any lumps. Once it has started to thicken add the rest of the milk, nutmeg, parmesan and a pinch of salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Continue to heat the sauce whilst stirring until thickened enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Take off the heat and set aside</li>
    </ol>
